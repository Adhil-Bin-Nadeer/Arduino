Smart Glass for Blind

It's an IoT project created using an arduino nano, ultrasonic H2SR04 and a buzzer.This project help the blind person to identify the obstacle infront of him/her.
 I  created this project during tech fest, So  to experience how it works. we create a maze  and the participant want to  wear this glass after the eyes were tighlty 
 closed and move through the maze.
